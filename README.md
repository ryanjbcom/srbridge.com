# website_srbridge.com
RJB, html, css, js for www.srbridge.com


** Update **
On 04/20/18, I renamed the index.html to reflect date.

Deploying a new index.html file with clean html5 code.
Removing older, unnecessary code mixed in.
As of 2018, anyone still using IE8? Why should I build a site to support responsive(ness) on IE8/9?

Enjoy
